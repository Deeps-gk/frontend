## Overview

Malnad Family Restaurant – Event Booking & Admin Management System is a full-stack web application developed to streamline event booking and enquiry management for a local family-run restaurant.  
The system enables customers to submit event booking requests online and allows restaurant administrators to view and manage these enquiries through an internal admin dashboard.

This project was built for real-world usage to replace manual and unstructured booking processes.

## Problem Statement

Event bookings were traditionally handled through phone calls and WhatsApp messages, which resulted in:

- Missed or delayed enquiries  
- No centralized data storage  
- Lack of structured event records  
- Difficulty in tracking and managing bookings efficiently  

The restaurant required a simple, reliable, and professional digital solution without depending on third-party platforms.

## Solution

A web-based event booking and management system was designed and implemented with the following capabilities:

- Customers can submit event booking enquiries via a responsive web interface  
- All booking data is securely stored in a centralized database  
- Restaurant administrators can view and manage enquiries in real time  
- The application is deployed and accessible for live usage

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
