Project Title:
Malnad Family Restaurant – Event Booking & Admin Management System

Project Type:
Full-Stack Web Application

Overview

Malnad Family Restaurant is a full-stack web application developed to streamline event booking and enquiry management for a local family-run restaurant. The system enables customers to submit event requests online and allows restaurant administrators to view and manage these enquiries through an internal admin dashboard.

Problem Statement

Traditional restaurant event bookings were handled manually via phone calls and WhatsApp messages, leading to:

Missed enquiries

Lack of centralized data

No structured record of events

Difficulty in tracking and responding efficiently

The restaurant required a simple, professional, and reliable digital solution without relying on third-party delivery platforms.

Solution

A web-based event booking system was designed and implemented where:

Customers can submit event booking enquiries via a responsive website

All enquiries are securely stored in a database

Admins can view bookings in real time through an admin interface

The system is deployed and accessible publicly for real-world usage

Technology Stack

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Deployment: Render (Backend), Local/Cloud Frontend Deployment

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Key Features

Event enquiry submission form

REST API for booking creation and retrieval

Admin dashboard to view all event bookings

Responsive UI for mobile and desktop

Environment-based configuration for development and production

Secure data handling using server-side validation

Outcome

The system provides the restaurant with:

Centralized event enquiry management

Improved response time to customers

Professional online presence

Scalable foundation for future enhancements such as notifications and analytics

Learning Outcomes

Practical experience building and deploying a full-stack application

Hands-on debugging of real-world frontend–backend integration issues

Experience with MongoDB Atlas, REST APIs, and deployment workflows

Understanding of product thinking and business-oriented development

Future Enhancements (Optional)

Admin authentication

WhatsApp or email notifications for new bookings

Analytics dashboard for event trends

Multi-branch support# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
